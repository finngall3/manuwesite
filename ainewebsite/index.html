      <h1>Manchester United in the Carabao Cup</h1>
      <p>Manchester United won the 2022/23 Carabao Cup through a remarkable run of form thanks in large part due to their new manager Erik Ten Hag. Manchester United had recently come off what was widely regarded as their worst season ever so to go on and win a trophy the year after, and after 6 years of not winning any trophies, this was a massive victory for the Manchester United fans.</p>
