  <h1>United Vs Charlton Athletic: 3-0</h1>
  <p>In the Quarter Final, United were drawn to play Charlton Athletic. Charlton Athletic play in Football League One. The 3rd tier of English football and 2 leagues below Manchester United. Really and truly they were extremely lucky to get as far into the competition as they did and posed no real threat to Manchester United. The one bit of hope Charlton had was that United's starman Marcus Rashford was not starting and would be on the bench. But as expected, United cruised to an easy win. The scoring was opened in the 21st minute with a magnificent strike from outside the box from right winger Antony. In the 60th minute, Antony was subbed off for Marcus Rashford, who did not change the game but made a massive impact right at the end. With 2 brilliant goals from Rashford in the 90th and 94th minutes, the final score was 3-0 to United who were going on to the Semi-Finals.</p>
